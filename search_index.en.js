GPT/Bert based models for custom tasks I often found myself in the unfortunate situation of \"Cuda out of memory\". Turns out\nthat the transformer models are memory intensive. In addition to this, the memory reuirements increase with the sequence length.\nIt will be of interest to get some idea of how much memory is needed to finetune/train the model. A rough estimate will help in estimating the resources needed for the task.\nIf you are short at time or don't want to go into details. You can skip to TL;DR and insights.\nAll neural network are trained with back propagation. Keeping this in mind following simple relation appears to give us memory usage\ntotal_memory = memory_modal + memory_activations + memory_gradients\n\nHere memory_modal means the memory required to store all parameters of the model.\nActivations are calculated and stored in forward pass. Gradients are calculated using activations. Also number of gradients are generally equal to number of parameters, resulting in memory_gradients = memory_modal. Hence, we can write:\ntotal_memory = memory_modal + 2 * memory_activations\n\nIn essence we need to find the values for memory_modal and memory_activations to estimate the total memory required.\nEstimating model's memory requirements\nLets take GPT as an example. GPT consists of a number of transformer blocks (let's call it n_tr_blocks from now on). Each transformer block consists of following structure:\nmulti_headed_attention --&gt; layer_normalization --&gt; MLP --&gt;layer_normalization\n\nEach multi_headed_attention element consists of value nets, key and query. Let's say that each of these have n_head attention heads and dim dimensions. MLP also has a dimension of n_head * dim. The memory needed to store these will be \ntotal_memory = memory of multi_headed_attention + memory of MLP\n\t\t\t = memory of value nets + memory of key + memory of query + memory of MLP\n\t\t\t = square_of(n_head * dim) + square_of(n_head * dim) + square_of(n_head * dim) + square_of(n_head * dim)\n\t\t\t = 4*square_of(n_head * dim)\n\nSince our modal contains n_tr_blocks units of these blocks. Total memory required by the modal becomes.\nmemory_modal = 4*n_tr_blocks*square_of(n_head * dim)\n\nAbove estimation does not take into account the memory required for biases, since that is mostly static and does not depend on things like batch size, input sequence etc.\nEstimating model activation's memory requirements\nMulti headed attention is generally a softmax. More specifically it can written as:\nmulti_headed_attention = softmax(query * key * sequence_length) * value_net\n\nquery key and value_net all have a tensor shape of \n[batch_size, n_head, sequence_length, dim]\n\nquery * key * sequence_length operation gives following resultant shape:\n[batch_size, n_head, sequence_length, sequence_length]\n\nThis finally gives the memory cost of activation function as\nmemory_softmax  = batch_size * n_head * square_of(sequence_length)\n\nquery * key * sequence_length operation multiplied by value_net has the shape of [batch_size, n_head, sequence_length, dim]. MLP also has the same shape. So memory cost of these operations become:\nmemory of MLP  = batch_size * n_head * sequence_length * dim\nmemory of value_net  = batch_size * n_head * sequence_length * dim\n\nThis gives us the memory of model activation per block:\nmem_act = memory_softmax + memory_value_net + memory_MLP\n\t\t= batch_size * n_head * square_of(sequence_length)\n\t\t  + batch_size * n_head * sequence_length * dim\n\t\t  + batch_size * n_head * sequence_length * dim\n\t\t= batch_size * n_head * sequence_length * (sequence_length + 2*dim)\n\nMemory of model activation across the model will be:\nn_tr_blocks * (batch_size * n_head * sequence_length * (sequence_length + 2*dim))\n\nSumming it all up\nTo sum up total memory needed for fine-tuning/training transformer models is:\ntotal_memory = memory_modal + 2 * memory_activations\n\nMemory for modal is:\nmemory_modal = 4*n_tr_blocks*square_of(n_head * dim)\n\nAnd memory for model activations is:\nn_tr_blocks * (batch_size * n_head * sequence_length * (sequence_length + 2*dim))\n\nThese rough formulas can be written more succintly using following notation.\nR = n_tr_blocks = number of transformer blocks in the model\nN = n_head = number of attention heads\nD = dim = dimension of each attention head\nB = batch_size = batch size\nS = sequence_length = input sequence length\n\n\n\nmemory modal = 4 * R * N^2 * D^2\n\nmemory activations = RBNS(S + 2D)\n\nTotal memory consumption if modal training is\nM = (4 * R * N^2 * D^2) + RBNS(S + 2D)\n\nIf we have a very long sequence lengths S &gt;&gt; D S + 2D &lt;--&gt; S hence M in this case becomes:\nM = (4 * R * N^2 * D^2) + RBNS(S) = 4*R*N^2*D^2 + RBNS^2\n\nM is directly proportional to square of length of input sequence for large sequences\nM is lineraly proportional to the batch size.\n\nTLDR\nThese rough formula for estimating the memory requirements of fine tuning transformer models\nR = n_tr_blocks = number of transformer blocks in the model\nN = n_head = number of attention heads\nD = dim = dimension of each attention head\nB = batch_size = batch size\nS = sequence_length = input sequence length\n\n\n\nmemory modal = 4 * R * N^2 * D^2\n\nmemory activations = RBNS(S + 2D)\n\ntotal memory required = ((4 * R * N^2 * D^2) + RBNS(S + 2D)) * float64 memory in bytes\n\nInsights\n\n\nMemory consumption is directly proportional to square of length of input sequence for large sequences\n\n\nMemory consumption is lineraly proportional to the batch size.\n\n\n","id":"https://schartz.github.io/blog/estimating-memory-requirements-of-transformers/","title":"Estimating memory requirements of transformer networks"},"https://schartz.github.io/blog/installing-tensorflow-on-ubuntu/":{"body":"Setting up Tensorflow with GPU support gave me good deal of pain. Internet is full of tutorials\nwith older releases of Tensorflow. Some of them use an approach of installing CUDA toolkit via apt.\nThis approach is not appropriate because of a number of reasons.\nTensorflow 2.0 is in alpha stage now.\nIt has a planned stable release in second quarter of 2019. Soon enough I'll be upgrading to latest stable.\nNvidia drivers have a penchant for being compatible with specific versions of CUDA toolkit, to make matters \na bit more complicated Tensorflow requires a specific version of Nvidia drivers.\nUbuntu graphics-driver ppa has latest Nvidia drivers nvidia-driver-430 at the time of writing. However, requirements for \nTensorflow 13.1 are nvidia-driver-410 and cuda-toolkit-10.0. cuDNN 7.5.0 is also required for Tensorflow.\nLet's begin with a clean install.\nStep1: Install Nvidia drivers\nIf you have nvidia-driver-410 meta package installed, you can skip this step.\nStart by adding Ubuntu Graphics Driver PPA if not already added. \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa    \nsudo apt-get update\n\nRemove any nvidia drivers. We are doing a clean install\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia* \nsudo apt-get autoremove \nsudo apt-get autoclean \nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/cuda*\n\nIf you have a Secure Boot UEFI enabled system it will ask you to set a password which\nyou'll need to enter at the time of reboot. This is a one time only process.\nNow reboot your system.\nCheck if install was successful by running following\nnvidia-smi\n\nIt should print something similar to following.\n\nNotice the version of CUDA toolkit stated by the driver.\nVersion 410 of nvidia driver for Linux is only compatible with CUDA toolkit version 10.\nIf your screen resolution is messed up after driver install, fix it with following.\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nStep2: Install CUDA toolkit 10.0\nInstall the dependencies\nsudo apt-get install g++ freeglut3-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev\n\nHead over to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive\nand download the CUDA archive.  Make sure to download runfile.\n\nInstall it.\nsudo sh cuda_10.0.130_410.48_linux.run\n\nIn the installation process installer will complain that you are about to install an unsupported configuration.\nAnswer yes to that. Installer complains about 'unsupported configuration', because it's not the latest version of CUDA toolkit.\nHowever, latest stable version of Tensorflow (1.13 at the time of writing) requires CUDA 10.0 specifically.\nInstaller will also ask to add a symlink. Answer yes to that as well.\nFinally add following to your ~/.bashrc and/or ~/.zshrc in accordance with whichever shell you use.\nexport PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n\nAfterwards load these PATH additions in your current shell session as well as run ldconfig\nRun source ~/.zshrc if you are in Z shell.\nsource ~/.bashrc\nsudo ldconfig\n\nStep3: Install cuDNN 7.5.0\nGo to https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive and click download cuDNN button.\nNvidia will require you to create an account (if you don't already have one). After logging into your Nvidia Developer Account accept the agreement\nClick on cuDNN archive which says Download cuDNN v7.5.0 (Feb 21, 2019), for CUDA 10.0 and download cuDNN Library for Linux\nHere is the direct download link to the same.\nBut there is no guarantee that it will work all the time. If the direct doesn't work, follow above steps.\nOnce you have downloaded the cuDNN archive put it at correct place by running:\ntar -xf cudnn-10.0-linux-x64-v7.5.0.56.tgz\nsudo cp -R cuda/include/* /usr/local/cuda-10.0/include\nsudo cp -R cuda/lib64/* /usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64\n\nAlso install a small dependency \nsudo apt-get install libcupti-dev\n\nAdd following to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\nAnd finally\nsource ~/.bashrc\nsudo ldconfig\n\nStep4: Test it\nIt's recommended that you have a virtual environment for this. \nI prefer virtualenvwrapper. \nYou can use any tool to create virtual env.\nmkvirtualenv tfgpu\nworkon tfgpu\npip install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1\npip show tensorflow-gpu\n\nIt should show something like this \n\nNow go build some AI \n","id":"https://schartz.github.io/blog/installing-tensorflow-on-ubuntu/","title":"Installing tensorflow 1.13 on Elementary OS Juno."},"https://schartz.github.io/blog/the-shape-of-tensor/":{"body":"Tensors are the primary data structures used by neural networks. And they are rather fascinating as well.\nMachine learning and by extension deep learning is an interdisciplinary field. Its interesting\nto note how many different people from many different fields came to same concepts. Specific to this writing,\nthe concept of tensors.\nThe concept of tensor is a mathematical generalization of more specific concepts, vectors and matrices in particular.\nIn neural networks transformations, input, output etc are performed via tensors.\nTo build a good enough concept let's start with a matrix of some simple concepts from computer science and mathematics.\n  \nThe same can also be represented via following matrix\n  \nThis pseudo-mathematical notation gives us a nice one-to-one relationship between concepts of number, array and 2d-array from computer science\nto the concepts of scalar, vector and matrix in mathematics.\nLet's write examples of above 6 concepts to better understand them\n\nnumber   ---&gt; 9\nscalar   ---&gt; 9\n\n\n\narray    ---&gt; [5, 8, 3]\nvector   ---&gt; (5i, 8j, 3k) \n                   or \n              5i + 8j + 3k \n                or simply \n                (5, 8, 3)\n\n\n\n2d-array ---&gt; [\n                [1, 2, 3]\n                [4, 5, 6]\n                [7, 8, 9]\n              ]\n              \n              \nmatrix   ---&gt; |1, 2, 3|\n              |4, 5, 6|\n              |7, 8, 9|\n\n\nThe index notation\nUpon closer inspection of the above examples it's apparent that to access any element \nin each representation, we need the same number of indices in the related concepts of computer science and mathematics.\nFor example, to access an element in an array we need following notation\nmy_array = [5, 8, 3]\nmy_array[2] ---&gt; 8\n\nSimilarly to access a component of a mathematical vector we need one index, and, vice-versa for matrix and 2d-array. We have following underlying pattern:\nIndices RequiredComputer ScienceMathematics\n0numberscalar\n1arrayvector\n22d-arraymatrix\n\nThis gives us a working framework to make the generalization. \nMeet the tensors\nWhen we have more than two indices to refer to a specific element in a data structures (or mathematical, structure) we stop \ntreating them with special names like scalars, vectors, matrices etc. Instead we address them  with a more generalized language.\nWe call them Tensors.\nThis gives us following table\nIndices RequiredComputer ScienceMathematics\n0numberscalar\n1arrayvector\n22d-arraymatrix\nnnd-arraytensor\n\nFor all practical purposes in programming. It is good enough to remember that:\nTensors are multidimensional arrays.\nComing back to the part of generalization part.

The dimension of a tensor does not tell us how many components exist within the tensor.\nIf we have a three dimensional vector from three dimensional euclidean space, we have an ordered triple with three components.\nA three dimensional tensor, however, can have many more than three components. Our two dimensional tensor 2d-array for example has nine components.\n2d-array ---&gt; [\n                [1, 2, 3]\n                [4, 5, 6]\n                [7, 8, 9]\n              ]\n\nRank and Axes of Tensor\nA tensor's rank is equal to the number of indices are needed to access to a specific element within the tensor.\nIn our example our 2d-array tensor is of rank two because we need to indices to access any element inside it.\nelem = 2d-array[i][j]\n\nAxis refers to a particular dimension of a tensor.\nIn case of a tensor of rank 2, it has 2 dimensions (also called 2 axis), hence a requirement of 2 indices (one for each axis or dimension) to access any element.\nThe length of each axis tells us how many indexes are available along each axis.\nThe Shape of Tensor\nThe shape of a tensor is determined by the length of each axis, so if we know the shape of a given tensor, then we know the length of each axis, and this tells us how many indexes are available along each axis.\nThe shape of a tensor gives us the length of each axis of the tensor.\nGoing back to our familiar 2d-array tensor\n2d-array ---&gt; [\n                [1, 2, 3]\n                [4, 5, 6]\n                [7, 8, 9]\n              ]\n\nWe say that above tensor's shape is 3 x 3 which means that it has 2 axis (or dimensions) of length 3 each.\nTensor's shape is super important.\nHigher rank tensors tend to become more and more abstract very quickly.\nIn this case shape provides us some reference point to understand them.\nAdditionally tensors being the data structures of neural networks flow through various layers of the network. \nMore than often they are required to be in a certain shape. \nReshaping the tensor\nReshaping is a simple yet very powerful concept. \nSimply put, reshaping refers to the process of changing the order of axis (dimensions) in the data structure.\nFor example lets say we have a tensor of rank 2 as follows:\nShape 2 x 3\n\n[\n  [4, 5, 6]\n  [7, 8, 9]\n]\n\nIt can be reshaped to various shapes as follows:\nShape 6 x 1\n\n[  \n   [4],  \n   [5],  \n   [6],  \n   [7],  \n   [8],  \n   [9],  \n]\n\nShape 3 x 2\n\n[\n    [4, 7],\n    [5, 8],\n    [6, 9]\n]\n\n\nShape 1 x 6\n\n[\n    [4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],\n]\n\n\nImportant point to note about reshaping operation is that it changes the shape, ie. it changes the ordering of individual elements inside a tensor, but is does not change the underlying elements themselves.\nAbove is a very crude but workable conceptual introduction to tensors.\nIt is by no means rigorous. However, it serves as good enough starting point while trying to work with Neural Networks from a \"mathematically un-inclined programmer\" perspective.\nRigorous mathematical treatment of this subject is of utmost importance if one wishes to do anything meaningful in the area of Deep Learning.\nFor a just enough introduction, this is a must read:\nIntruduction to Tensor Calculus, Kees Dullemond &amp; Kasper Peeters.\nI'll also highly recommend Tensor Calculus Made Simple, Taha Sochi\nI enjoyed my time with the book.

TLS(Transport Layer Security) is the encryption \nprotocol which powers the HTTPS. mTLS is a spin on TLS where both client and server are going to exchange certificates before communication begins.\nLet's understand this in plain English.\n1 TLS\nTLS (sometimes referred as SSL) is a very widely used protocol. It is used to secure client server communication by encrypting the communicated information. It involves Public key infrastructure (PKI), TLS Certificates, TLS Handshakes.\n1.1 Public key infrastructure (PKI)\n\nYou have two keys, called Public and Private keys.\nBoth of these keys come with a set expiration period.\nData encrypted by the Public key can only be decrypted by its Private key.\nData encrypted by the Private key can only be decrypted by its Public key.\n\ndata --------&gt; [public key] -----&gt; encrypted data\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  |\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \\|/\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata &lt;--------[private key]\n\n\n\n\ndata --------&gt; [private key] -----&gt; encrypted data\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  |\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \\|/\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdata &lt;--------[public key]\n\n\nThe server freely provides Public key to anyone. But guards the Private key with it's life.\n1.2 TLS Certificates\nA TLS certificate is a data file that containing the public key, information of the encryption algorithm,  information of the certificate issuer, and the certificate's expiration date.\nTLS certificates are issued by a trusted third party called certificate authority. Sometimes written as CA or CA authority.\nLet's encrypt is one such trusted certificate issuer authority among many others.\nTLS certificate = Public key + \n\t\t\t\t  encryption algorithm infromation + \n\t\t\t\t  identity information + \n\t\t\t\t  expiry date\n\n1.3 TLS Handshakes\nThe TLS handshake is the process to achieve 2 things:\n\nChecking the TLS certificate validity \nMaking sure that the server actually owns the private key.\n\nFirst part is done by validating the certificate against a list of root CA certificates which are already available on the client side.\nOn Linux systems, typically a file located at /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt contains the verification certificates of all the trusted certificate authorities. If this check fails, client shall panic about an un-trusted certificate.\nSecond part is done by asking the server to decrypt something encrypted by the Public key file from the provided certificate.\n2 How TLS works\nWith above concepts, working of TLS is fairly straightforward.\nThe server has a TLS certificate and the key pair as well. Process goes something like following:\n\nClient connects to server\nServer sends its TLS certificate\nClient verifies the server's certificate (TLS handshake)\nClient and server exchange information over encrypted TLS connection\n\n\n3 How mTLS works\nMutual Transport Level Security is built on top of TLS. Process is very similar, but with an added twist of client bringing it's own certificate and key pair to the picture. mTLS process looks like following:\n\nClient connects to server\nServer sends its TLS certificate\nClient verifies the server's certificate (TLS handshake)\nClient sends its TLS certificate\nServer verifies the client's certificate (TLS handshake, again)\nServer grants access\nClient and server exchange information over encrypted TLS connection\n\n\n4 Code time\nTo get going we shall need \n\nA root certificate to sign both client and server certificates\nA server certificate\nA client certificate\nNGINX in docker to run the mTLS configured server\nHumble curl\n\nWe shall go ahead with a simple bash file to get our certificates\nStart by creating a file named mtls_test.sh and enter the following contents.\n#!/bin/bash\n\nmkdir certs\ncd certs\n\n# save pass in a file for root certificate\nprintf secret &gt; ca_passphrase.txt\n\n# generate 4096 bit RSA private key in des3 fromat.

Yes there are versions of this thing.\nThis version is specified in RFC 5280. It is also known as PKIX, full form being \"Public Key Infrastructure (X.509)\"\nX509 File types\nThere are a bunch of file type names being thrown around X.509. Occasionally and incorrectly it is said that they are all interchangeable. \nWhile in come cases they may be interchangeable. It is always better to know your certificates and label them accordingly.\nEncodings (may be used as file extensions on Windows systems)\n\n.DER = The DER extension is used for binary DER encoded certificates. These files may also bear the CER or the CRT extension.\nIt would be better to say that \"This is a DER encoded certificate\" rather than \"This is DER certificate\".\n.PEM = The PEM extension is used for X.509v3 files which contain ASCII (Base64) encoded data prefixed with a \"—–\nBEGIN ...\" type of line.\n\nCommon file extensions\n\n\nCRT = The CRT extension is used for certificates. The certificates may be encoded as binary DER or as ASCII PEM. The CER and\nCRT extensions are nearly synonymous. Most common among *nix systems\n\n\nCER = alternate form of .crt (Microsoft Convention) You can use MS to convert .crt to .cer (.both DER encoded .cer, or base64[PEM]\nencoded .cer) The .cer file extension is also recognized by IE as a command to run a MS cryptoAPI command (specifically\nrundll32.exe cryptext.dll,CryptExtOpenCER) which displays a dialogue for importing and/or viewing certificate contents.\n\n\n.KEY = The KEY extension is used both for public and private PKCS#8 keys. The keys may be encoded as binary DER or as ASCII\nPEM.\n\n\nThe only time CRT and CER can safely be interchanged is when the encoding type can be identical. (ie PEM encoded CRT = PEM encoded\nCER)\nBasic OpenSSL Certificate Operations\nThere are four basic types of certificate manipulations. View, Transform, Combination , and Extraction\nTo view PEM encoded certificates\nopenssl x509 -in certfile -text noout\n\nHere certfile can have any of the above mentioned encodings. Following error might occur:\nunable to load certificate\n12626:error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line:pem_lib.c:647:Expecting: TRUSTED CERTIFICATE\n\nThis typically means that you are trying to read a certificate which is in DER format.\nTo view a certificate use following\nopenssl x509 -in certfile -inform der -text -noout\n\nYou will encounter following error if you try to run above command on PEM encoded certificate:\nunable to load certificate\n13978:error:0D0680A8:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_CHECK_TLEN:wrong tag:tasn_dec.c:1306:\n13978:error:0D07803A:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_ITEM_EX_D2I:nested asn1 error:tasn_dec.c:380:Type=X509\n\nPEM to DER can be transformed like following\nopenssl x509 -in certfile -outform der -out cert.der\n\nSimilarly DER to PEM can be transformed like following\nopenssl x509 -in certfile -inform der -outform pem -out cert.pem\n\nCombining X.509 certificate components\nIn some cases it is advantageous to combine multiple pieces of the X.509 infrastructure into a single file. One common example would be to\ncombine both the private key and public key into the same certificate.\nThe easiest way to combine certs keys and chains is to convert each to a PEM encoded certificate then simple copy the contents of each file\ninto a new file. This is suitable for combining files to use in a number of applications.\nQuite often you will come across a file with .p12 extensions.\nThis type of file uses that uses PKCS#12 (Public Key Cryptography Standard #12) encryption.\nIt is typically used as a portable format for transferring personal private keys or other sensitive information.\nIt is also used by various security and encryption programs.\nExtracting components from certificates\nAn X.509 certificate contains ONLY the public key and NEVER contains a private key.\nTo extract the public key from it use following\nopenssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in certfile.pem\n\nTo calculate fingerprint/thumbprint/hash/signature of X.509 certificate in SHA256 use following\nopenssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in certfile.pem\n\nTo calculate fingerprint/thumbprint/hash/signature of public key of X.509 certificate in SHA256 use following\nopenssl x509 -in certfile.pem -pubkey -noout | grep -v '^-' | base64 -d | openssl sha256\n\nIf you have your certificate in DER encoding, simple add -inform der to above commands accordingly.\n","id":"https://schartz.github.io/blog/x509-certificates-explained/","title":"X.509 Certificates Explained"}},"docInfo":{"https://schartz.github.io/":{"body":2,"title":2},"https://schartz.github.io/about/":{"body":2,"title":0},"https://schartz.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://schartz.github.io/blog/estimating-memory-requirements-of-transformers/":{"body":526,"title":5},"https://schartz.github.io/blog/installing-tensorflow-on-ubuntu/":{"body":442,"title":6},"https://schartz.github.io/blog/the-shape-of-tensor/":{"body":653,"title":2},"https://schartz.github.io/blog/tls-and-mtls-deep-dive/":{"body":1018,"title":4},"https://schartz.github.io/blog/transformers-and-attention/":{"body":0,"title":7},"https://schartz.github.io/blog/x509-certificates-explained/":{"body":449,"title":3}},"length":9},"lang":"English"};
