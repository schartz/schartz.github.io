up Tensorflow with GPU support gave me good deal of pain. Internet is full of tutorials\nwith older releases of Tensorflow. Some of them use an approach of installing CUDA toolkit via apt.\nThis approach is not appropriate because of a number of reasons.\nTensorflow 2.0 is in alpha stage now.\nIt has a planned stable release in second quarter of 2019. Soon enough I'll be upgrading to latest stable.\nNvidia drivers have a penchant for being compatible with specific versions of CUDA toolkit, to make matters \na bit more complicated Tensorflow requires a specific version of Nvidia drivers.\nUbuntu graphics-driver ppa has latest Nvidia drivers nvidia-driver-430 at the time of writing. However, requirements for \nTensorflow 13.1 are nvidia-driver-410 and cuda-toolkit-10.0. cuDNN 7.5.0 is also required for Tensorflow.\nLet's begin with a clean install.\nStep1: Install Nvidia drivers\nIf you have nvidia-driver-410 meta package installed, you can skip this step.\nStart by adding Ubuntu Graphics Driver PPA if not already added. \nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa    \nsudo apt-get update\n\nRemove any nvidia drivers. We are doing a clean install\nsudo apt-get purge nvidia* \nsudo apt-get autoremove \nsudo apt-get autoclean \nsudo rm -rf /usr/local/cuda*\n\nIf you have a Secure Boot UEFI enabled system it will ask you to set a password which\nyou'll need to enter at the time of reboot. This is a one time only process.\nNow reboot your system.\nCheck if install was successful by running following\nnvidia-smi\n\nIt should print something similar to following.\n\nNotice the version of CUDA toolkit stated by the driver.\nVersion 410 of nvidia driver for Linux is only compatible with CUDA toolkit version 10.\nIf your screen resolution is messed up after driver install, fix it with following.\nsudo nvidia-xconfig\n\nStep2: Install CUDA toolkit 10.0\nInstall the dependencies\nsudo apt-get install g++ freeglut3-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev\n\nHead over to https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-10.0-download-archive\nand download the CUDA archive.  Make sure to download runfile.\n\nInstall it.\nsudo sh cuda_10.0.130_410.48_linux.run\n\nIn the installation process installer will complain that you are about to install an unsupported configuration.\nAnswer yes to that. Installer complains about 'unsupported configuration', because it's not the latest version of CUDA toolkit.\nHowever, latest stable version of Tensorflow (1.13 at the time of writing) requires CUDA 10.0 specifically.\nInstaller will also ask to add a symlink. Answer yes to that as well.\nFinally add following to your ~/.bashrc and/or ~/.zshrc in accordance with whichever shell you use.\nexport PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.0/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}\n\nAfterwards load these PATH additions in your current shell session as well as run ldconfig\nRun source ~/.zshrc if you are in Z shell.\nsource ~/.bashrc\nsudo ldconfig\n\nStep3: Install cuDNN 7.5.0\nGo to https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive and click download cuDNN button.\nNvidia will require you to create an account (if you don't already have one). After logging into your Nvidia Developer Account accept the agreement\nClick on cuDNN archive which says Download cuDNN v7.5.0 (Feb 21, 2019), for CUDA 10.0 and download cuDNN Library for Linux\nHere is the direct download link to the same.\nBut there is no guarantee that it will work all the time. If the direct doesn't work, follow above steps.\nOnce you have downloaded the cuDNN archive put it at correct place by running:\ntar -xf cudnn-10.0-linux-x64-v7.5.0.56.tgz\nsudo cp -R cuda/include/* /usr/local/cuda-10.0/include\nsudo cp -R cuda/lib64/* /usr/local/cuda-10.0/lib64\n\nAlso install a small dependency \nsudo apt-get install libcupti-dev\n\nAdd following to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n\nAnd finally\nsource ~/.bashrc\nsudo ldconfig\n\nStep4: Test it\nIt's recommended that you have a virtual environment for this. \nI prefer virtualenvwrapper. \nYou can use any tool to create virtual env.\nmkvirtualenv tfgpu\nworkon tfgpu\npip install tensorflow-gpu==1.13.1\npip show tensorflow-gpu\n\nIt should show something like this \n\nNow go build some AI \n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/installing-tensorflow-on-ubuntu/","title":"Installing tensorflow 1.13 on Elementary OS Juno."},"http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/the-shape-of-tensor/":{"body":"Tensors are the primary data structures used by neural networks.

Specific to this writing,\nthe concept of tensors.\nThe concept of tensor is a mathematical generalization of more specific concepts, vectors and matrices in particular.\nIn neural networks transformations, input, output etc are performed via tensors.\nTo build a good enough concept let's start with a matrix of some simple concepts from computer science and mathematics.\n  \nThe same can also be represented via following matrix\n  \nThis pseudo-mathematical notation gives us a nice one-to-one relationship between concepts of number, array and 2d-array from computer science\nto the concepts of scalar, vector and matrix in mathematics.\nLet's write examples of above 6 concepts to better understand them\n\nnumber   ---&gt; 9\nscalar   ---&gt; 9\n\n\n\narray    ---&gt; [5, 8, 3]\nvector   ---&gt; (5i, 8j, 3k) \n                   or \n              5i + 8j + 3k \n                or simply \n                (5, 8, 3)\n\n\n\n2d-array ---&gt; [\n                [1, 2, 3]\n                [4, 5, 6]\n                [7, 8, 9]\n              ]\n              \n              \nmatrix   ---&gt; |1, 2, 3|\n              |4, 5, 6|\n              |7, 8, 9|\n\n\nThe index notation\nUpon closer inspection of the above examples it's apparent that to access any element \nin each representation, we need the same number of indices in the related concepts of computer science and mathematics.\nFor example, to access an element in an array we need following notation\nmy_array = [5, 8, 3]\nmy_array[2] ---&gt; 8\n\nSimilarly to access a component of a mathematical vector we need one index, and, vice-versa for matrix and 2d-array. We have following underlying pattern:\nIndices RequiredComputer ScienceMathematics\n0numberscalar\n1arrayvector\n22d-arraymatrix\n\nThis gives us a working framework to make the generalization. \nMeet the tensors\nWhen we have more than two indices to refer to a specific element in a data structures (or mathematical, structure) we stop \ntreating them with special names like scalars, vectors, matrices etc. Instead we address them  with a more generalized language.\nWe call them Tensors.\nThis gives us following table\nIndices RequiredComputer ScienceMathematics\n0numberscalar\n1arrayvector\n22d-arraymatrix\nnnd-arraytensor\n\nFor all practical purposes in programming. It is good enough to remember that:\nTensors are multidimensional arrays.\nComing back to the part of generalization part. It's safe to draw following conclusions:\n\nscalar    ---&gt; 0 dimensional tensor  ---&gt; number\nvector    ---&gt; 1 dimensional tensor  ---&gt; simple array\nmatrix    ---&gt; 2 dimensional tensor  ---&gt; 2d array\nnd array  ---&gt; n dimensional tensor ---&gt; nd array\n\nThe dimension of a tensor a completely different entity from what we mean when we refer to the dimension of a vector in a vector space. The dimension of a tensor does not tell us how many components exist within the tensor.\nIf we have a three dimensional vector from three dimensional euclidean space, we have an ordered triple with three components.\nA three dimensional tensor, however, can have many more than three components. Our two dimensional tensor 2d-array for example has nine components.\n2d-array ---&gt; [\n                [1, 2, 3]\n                [4, 5, 6]\n                [7, 8, 9]\n              ]\n\nRank and Axes of Tensor\nA tensor's rank is equal to the number of indices are needed to access to a specific element within the tensor.\nIn our example our 2d-array tensor is of rank two because we need to indices to access any element inside it.\nelem = 2d-array[i][j]\n\nAxis refers to a particular dimension of a tensor.\nIn case of a tensor of rank 2, it has 2 dimensions (also called 2 axis), hence a requirement of 2 indices (one for each axis or dimension) to access any element.\nThe length of each axis tells us how many indexes are available along each axis.\nThe Shape of Tensor\nThe shape of a tensor is determined by the length of each axis, so if we know the shape of a given tensor, then we know the length of each axis, and this tells us how many indexes are available along each axis.\nThe shape of a tensor gives us the length of each axis of the tensor.\nGoing back to our familiar 2d-array tensor\n2d-array ---&gt; [\n                [1, 2, 3]\n                [4, 5, 6]\n                [7, 8, 9]\n              ]\n\nWe say that above tensor's shape is 3 x 3 which means that it has 2 axis (or dimensions) of length 3 each.\nTensor's shape is super important.\nHigher rank tensors tend to become more and more abstract very quickly.\nIn this case shape provides us some reference point to understand them.\nAdditionally tensors being the data structures of neural networks flow through various layers of the network. \nMore than often they are required to be in a certain shape. \nReshaping the tensor\nReshaping is a simple yet very powerful concept. \nSimply put, reshaping refers to the process of changing the order of axis (dimensions) in the data structure.\nFor example lets say we have a tensor of rank 2 as follows:\nShape 2 x 3\n\n[\n  [4, 5, 6]\n  [7, 8, 9]\n]\n\nIt can be reshaped to various shapes as follows:\nShape 6 x 1\n\n[  \n   [4],  \n   [5],  \n   [6],  \n   [7],  \n   [8],  \n   [9],  \n]\n\nShape 3 x 2\n\n[\n    [4, 7],\n    [5, 8],\n    [6, 9]\n]\n\n\nShape 1 x 6\n\n[\n    [4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],\n]\n\n\nImportant point to note about reshaping operation is that it changes the shape, ie. it changes the ordering of individual elements inside a tensor, but is does not change the underlying elements themselves.\nAbove is a very crude but workable conceptual introduction to tensors.\nIt is by no means rigorous. However, it serves as good enough starting point while trying to work with Neural Networks from a \"mathematically un-inclined programmer\" perspective.\nRigorous mathematical treatment of this subject is of utmost importance if one wishes to do anything meaningful in the area of Deep Learning.\nFor a just enough introduction, this is a must read:\nIntruduction to Tensor Calculus, Kees Dullemond &amp; Kasper Peeters.\nI'll also highly recommend Tensor Calculus Made Simple, Taha Sochi\nI enjoyed my time with the book. I hope you will too.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/the-shape-of-tensor/","title":"The Shape of Tensor"},"http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/x509-certificates-explained/":{"body":"To put it simply, X.509 certificate is a digital document encoded and/or\ndigitally signed according to RFC 5280\nGenerally speaking X.509 certificate refers to IETF's(Internet Engineering Task Force) PKIX certificate\nand CRL profile of the X.509 certificate v3 standard. Yes there are versions of this thing.\nThis version is specified in RFC 5280. It is also known as PKIX, full form being \"Public Key Infrastructure (X.509)\"\nX509 File types\nThere are a bunch of file type names being thrown around X.509. Occasionally and incorrectly it is said that they are all interchangeable. \nWhile in come cases they may be interchangeable. It is always better to know your certificates and label them accordingly.\nEncodings (may be used as file extensions on Windows systems)\n\n.DER = The DER extension is used for binary DER encoded certificates. These files may also bear the CER or the CRT extension.\nIt would be better to say that \"This is a DER encoded certificate\" rather than \"This is DER certificate\".\n.PEM = The PEM extension is used for X.509v3 files which contain ASCII (Base64) encoded data prefixed with a \"—–\nBEGIN ...\" type of line.\n\nCommon file extensions\n\n\nCRT = The CRT extension is used for certificates. The certificates may be encoded as binary DER or as ASCII PEM. The CER and\nCRT extensions are nearly synonymous. Most common among *nix systems\n\n\nCER = alternate form of .crt (Microsoft Convention) You can use MS to convert .crt to .cer (.both DER encoded .cer, or base64[PEM]\nencoded .cer) The .cer file extension is also recognized by IE as a command to run a MS cryptoAPI command (specifically\nrundll32.exe cryptext.dll,CryptExtOpenCER) which displays a dialogue for importing and/or viewing certificate contents.\n\n\n.KEY = The KEY extension is used both for public and private PKCS#8 keys. The keys may be encoded as binary DER or as ASCII\nPEM.\n\n\nThe only time CRT and CER can safely be interchanged is when the encoding type can be identical. (ie PEM encoded CRT = PEM encoded\nCER)\nBasic OpenSSL Certificate Operations\nThere are four basic types of certificate manipulations. View, Transform, Combination , and Extraction\nTo view PEM encoded certificates\nopenssl x509 -in certfile -text noout\n\nHere certfile can have any of the above mentioned encodings. Following error might occur:\nunable to load certificate\n12626:error:0906D06C:PEM routines:PEM_read_bio:no start line:pem_lib.c:647:Expecting: TRUSTED CERTIFICATE\n\nThis typically means that you are trying to read a certificate which is in DER format.\nTo view a certificate use following\nopenssl x509 -in certfile -inform der -text -noout\n\nYou will encounter following error if you try to run above command on PEM encoded certificate:\nunable to load certificate\n13978:error:0D0680A8:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_CHECK_TLEN:wrong tag:tasn_dec.c:1306:\n13978:error:0D07803A:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_ITEM_EX_D2I:nested asn1 error:tasn_dec.c:380:Type=X509\n\nPEM to DER can be transformed like following\nopenssl x509 -in certfile -outform der -out cert.der\n\nSimilarly DER to PEM can be transformed like following\nopenssl x509 -in certfile -inform der -outform pem -out cert.pem\n\nCombining X.509 certificate components\nIn some cases it is advantageous to combine multiple pieces of the X.509 infrastructure into a single file. One common example would be to\ncombine both the private key and public key into the same certificate.\nThe easiest way to combine certs keys and chains is to convert each to a PEM encoded certificate then simple copy the contents of each file\ninto a new file. This is suitable for combining files to use in a number of applications.\nQuite often you will come across a file with .p12 extensions.\nThis type of file uses that uses PKCS#12 (Public Key Cryptography Standard #12) encryption.\nIt is typically used as a portable format for transferring personal private keys or other sensitive information.\nIt is also used by various security and encryption programs.\nExtracting components from certificates\nAn X.509 certificate contains ONLY the public key and NEVER contains a private key.\nTo extract the public key from it use following\nopenssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in certfile.pem\n\nTo calculate fingerprint/thumbprint/hash/signature of X.509 certificate in SHA256 use following\nopenssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -inform pem -in certfile.pem\n\nTo calculate fingerprint/thumbprint/hash/signature of public key of X.509 certificate in SHA256 use following\nopenssl x509 -in certfile.pem -pubkey -noout | grep -v '^-' | base64 -d | openssl sha256\n\nIf you have your certificate in DER encoding, simple add -inform der to above commands accordingly.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/x509-certificates-explained/","title":"X.509 Certificates Explained"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:8000/":{"body":2,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/":{"body":2,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/installing-tensorflow-on-ubuntu/":{"body":442,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/the-shape-of-tensor/":{"body":653,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/x509-certificates-explained/":{"body":449,"title":3}},"length":6},"lang":"English"};
