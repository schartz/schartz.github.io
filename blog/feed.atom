        <p><code>This is the start of your first blog post.</code>  </p>
<p>This is what JigSaw told me as I booted things up for my first (serious-ish) blogging attempt.
I have been thinking about creating a blog for quite sometime. And finally my procrastination was beaten, this blog is here.  </p>
<p>I am not very sure about the direction for this blog. I'll be mostly documenting about the things I've been doing and an occasional <code>thought_dump()</code> will be present.  </p>
<p>The idea of running an entire blog from a Git repository seems interesting and a bit bewitching.  </p>
<p>I have interest in a lot of things. Consequently, there will be writings about a lot of things. And there will be a bunch of Computer Science, Programming and Mathematics.<br />
You have been warned.</p>    ]]></content>
